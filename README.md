# Description 
FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Artsâ€™ FIFA series. This project is about how accurately can we tell the position of the player just knowing physical and technical features of a player?I have applied KNN algorithm to solve the problem statement and used KNN, since the data is properly labelled and we have small dataset, KNN worked good on smaller datasets.
